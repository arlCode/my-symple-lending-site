    "review_body": "I called tonight after a very hard day and just called to see what kind of scam this would be. I have been in debt due to trying to go to school and pursue my DPT. It has been very stressful and depressing. However, tonight I got Kyle on the phone who gave me amazing advice and let me know that life happens but there is a way to get ahead of it. Not only did he provide me with all the information I needed, but he also gave me some personal life history. He was very candid during each step and help me look forward to paying down my debt and getting some of my life back. If you are wondering if this is a good idea, I would say that depends on you but I hope you get Kyle to let you know no matter what you decide, you're human.",
